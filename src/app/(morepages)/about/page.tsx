      <p className="text-lg">
      I&apos;m a passionate full-stack software engineer with a strong background in the MERN stack. After studying computer science at the university and completing a software engineering course at Decagon Institute, I embarked on my full-stack development journey in 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
      Since then, I&apos;ve been actively involved in open-source projects, freelance work, and collaborations with various companies, including my current role at Shortchase. I&apos;m proficient in technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Next.js, and Javascript, and I&apos;m always eager to learn and explore new tools and frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
      Fitness and personal development are also important to me. I exercise regularly and enjoy reading books on topics that inspire and challenge me. I&apos;ve even recently taken up swimming and am now looking to learn how to play the piano, as I have a deep appreciation for music and sound.
      </p>
      <p>
      Ultimately, what drives me is the excitement of being part of businesses that are growing from startups to multinational brands. I&apos;m always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to the success of the organizations I work with. If you&apos;re interested in working together, I&apos;d love to hear from you!
